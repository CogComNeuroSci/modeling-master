## Overview

This subfolder contains the code used for the MCP course (1 Master Exp. Psych. Ghent University) for AY 2018-2019.
Note: this folder is *not* maintained.

## Organization

The material is organized by chapter in the MCP handbook. Note that the titles of the subfolder explain what code can be found inside. The material used in the theory sessions, practical sessions and tests are all located in their respective chapter folder.

## Programming environment   

When last tested, all code could be executed using:

- python 3 (*v. 3.7.4*)
- anaconda (*v. 4.9.1*)
    
Install missing packages (e.g. both ```sklearn``` and ```scipy``` were needed for this course) using ```conda install [packageName]```
