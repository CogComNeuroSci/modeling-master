# installation
Steps to reproduced our environment:
1. Install Anaconda (anaconda.com)
2. Download your yml file (for Mac or for Windows)
3. Navigate to the location where your yml file is downloaded
4. On the anaconda prompt (terminal prompt on Mac), type
conda env create --file [name of yml file]

After installation, a new virtual environment should now have been created. Learn how to navigate Anaconda with its [cheat sheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf)
