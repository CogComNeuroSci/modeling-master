# gradient-based approaches to RL

Some code in this chapter (bandit) is direct application of chapter 8 material,
but some are in between chapter 8 and 9.
In particular, the deep-Q models for pole and mountaincar problems combine aspects of chapter 8 and 9. They are value-based (as in chapter 9), but the values are computed based on gradients (as in chapter 8).
