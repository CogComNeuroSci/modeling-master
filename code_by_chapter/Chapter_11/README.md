- crp.py simple example of the Chinese restaurant process
- free_energy.py assumes q(theta) is a point distribution (ie, as in the book)
- light.py considers the variational distribution q(theta), and how it bounds surprise
- tf2_vae.py implements a variational auto-encoder (code not by me; see citation in code)
