This script plots the pet detector's energy function in 2D (equation (2.3))

Inspecting the plot, you can see that if you start your descent on the "cat" side,
you will end up at a cat output ((y_cat, y_dog) = (10, 0));
and if you start at the "dog" side, you end up at a dog output ((y_cat, y_dog) = (0, 10)).
However, if the competition becomes too weak (abs(w) is small), then the minimum
of the energy function goes to (10, 10) (at a grid bounded by 10)

A tendency toward cat or dog can be implemented by multiplying the X or Y terms with a constant in Z = - X - Y - w*x*Y
Such a constant can be thought of as a drift rate for resp. cats or dogs (called in_cat and in_dog in the MCP book)
