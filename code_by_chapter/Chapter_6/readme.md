Simulations reported in chapter 6 were carried out with ch6_recovery.py.
This file uses ch6_generation.py (for generating data) and ch6_estimation.py (for estimating parameters); the latter
uses ch6_likelihood.py. Different models can be estimated by adding novel likelihood functions in ch6_likelihood.py.
