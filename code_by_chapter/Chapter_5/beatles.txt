A day in the life

I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.

He blew his mind out in a car
He didn’t notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
but I just had to look
Having read the book.

I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

I'd love to turn you on


A hard day's night

It’s been a hard da'’s night, and I been working like a dog
It’s been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you I'll find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And it’s worth it just to hear you say you're going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When I'm home everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight

Owww!

So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone
You know I feel ok

When I'm home everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

It's been a hard day's night, and I been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you I'll find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I feel alright
You know I feel alright...


A little help from my friends

A little help from my friends
What would you think if I sang out of tune,
Would you stand up and walk out on me.
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song,
And I'll try not to sing out of key.
I get by with a little help from my friends,
I get high with a little help from my friends,
Going to try with a little help from my friends.
What do I do when my love is away.
(Does it worry you to be alone)
How do I feel by the end of the day
(Are you sad because you’re on your own)
No I get by with a little help from my friends,
Do you need anybody,
I need somebody to love.
Could it be anybody
I want somebody to love.
Would you believe in a love at first sight,
Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time.
What do you see when you turn out the light,
I can’t tell you, but I know it’s mine.
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends,
Do you need anybody,
I just need somebody to love,
Could it be anybody,
I want somebody to love.
I get by with a little help from my friends,
Yes I get by with a little help from my friends,
With a little help from my friends.


A taste of honey

A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I dream of your first kiss, and then,
I feel upon my lips again,
A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
I’ll come back for the honey and you.

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart,
There lingers still, 'though we're far apart,
That taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

I will return, yes I will return,
I'll come back (he'll come back) for the honey (for the honey) and you.


Across the universe

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,
Possessing and caressing me.
Jai guru de va om
Nothing's gonna change my world,
Nothing's gonna change my world.

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,
That call me on and on across the universe,
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they
Tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothing’s gonna change my world,
Nothing’s gonna change my world.

Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing
Through my open views inviting and inciting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a
Million suns, it calls me on and on
Across the universe
Jai guru de va om
Nothing’s gonna change my world,
Nothing’s gonna change my world.

And your bird can sing

You tell me that you’ve got everything you want
And your bird can sing
But you don't get me, you don’t get me

You say you've seen seven wonders and your bird is green
But you can't see me, you can't see me

When your prized possessions start to wear you down
Look in my direction, I'll be round, I'll be round

When your bird is broken will it bring you down
You may be awoken, I'll be round, I'll be round

You tell me that you’ve heard every sound there is
And your bird can swim
But you can't hear me, you can't hear me


Anna (go to him)

Anna,
You come and ask me, girl,
To set you free, girl,
You say he loves you more than me,
So I will set you free,
Go with him.
Go with him.

Anna,
Girl, before you go now,
I want you to know, now,
That I still love you so,
But if he loves you mo',
Go with him.

All of my life,
I’ve been searchin' for a girl
To love me like I love you.
Oh, now.. But every girl I've ever had,
Breaks my heart and leaves my sad.
What am I, what am I supposed to do.

Anna,
Just one more thing, girl.
You give back your ring to me, and I will set you free,
Go with him.

Chorus

Anna,
Just one more thing, girl.
You give back your ring to me, and I will set you free,
Go with him.


Another girl

For I have found another girl, another girl.
You're making me say that I've got nobody but you,
But as from today, well, I've got somebody that’s new.
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want,
For I have got another girl, another girl.
She's sweeter than all the girls and I met quite a few.
Nobody in all the world can do what she can do.
And so I'm telling you, ''This time you'd better s.''
For I have got another girl. Another girl.
Who will love me till the end.
Through thick and thin
She will always be my friend.
I don't want to say that I've been unhappy with you,
But, as from today, well, I've seen somebody that's new.
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want,
For I have got another girl. Another girl.
Who will love me till the end.
Through thick and thin
She will always be my friend.

But, as from today, well, I’ve seen somebody that’s new.
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want,
For I have got another girl. Another girl.

Ask me why

I love you, 'cause you tell me things I want to know.
And it's true that it really only goes to show,
That I know,
That I, I, I, I should never, never, never be blue.

Now you're mine, my happiness still makes me cry.
And in time, you'll understand the reason why,
If I cry,
It's not because I'm sad, but you’re the only love that I've ever had.

I can't believe it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more misery.

Ask me why, I'll say I love you,
And I'm always thinking of you.

Baby's in black

Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue,
Tell me, oh what can I do?
She thinks of him and so she dresses in black,
And though he'll never come back, she's dressed in black.
Oh dear, what can I do?

Back in the U.S.S.R.

Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didn't get to bed last night
On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight
I’m back in the U.S.S.R.
You don't know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Been away so long I hardly knew the place
Gee it's good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey disconnect the phone
I'm back in the U.S.S.R.
You don't know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my mind.

I'm back in the U.S.S.R.
You don't know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Show me round your snow peaked mountains way down south
Take me to your daddy's farm
Let me hear your balalaika’s ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm.
I'm back in the U.S.S.R. 
You don’t know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.


Bad boy

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He won't do nothing right just sitting down and looks so good
He don't want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teachers chair
Puts some gum in little girl’s hair
Hey, junior, behave yourself

Buys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night she’s ready to poop
From rocking and a-rolling spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to s
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
Going tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbors cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mother's Laundromat
Well, mama’s head has got to s
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself


Because

Because the world is round it turns me on
Because the world is round...aaaaaahhhhhh

Because the wind is high it blows my mind
Because the wind is high......aaaaaaaahhhh

Love is all, love is new
Love is all, love is you

Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue.......aaaaaaaahhhh

Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh....

Cooking breakfast for the queen
The queen was in the parlour
Playing piano for the children of the king.

Picking flowers for a friend who came to play

Painting pictures for the childrens holiday.

With a message at the local bird and bee.

For a seance in the dark
With voices out of nowhere
Put on specially by the children for a lark.

Don’t bother me

Since she's been gone I want no one to talk to me.
It’s not the same but I'm to blame, it's plain to see.

So go away, leave me alone, don't bother me.

I can't believe that she would leave me on my own.
It’s just not right when every night I'm all alone.

I've got no time for you right now, don't bother me.

I know I'll never be the same if I don't get her back again.
Because I know she'll always be the only girl for me.

But 'till she’s here please don't come near, just stay away.
I'll let you know when she's come home. Until that day,

Don’t come around, leave me alone, don't bother me.

Don't let me down, don't let me down.
Don't let me down, don't let me down.

Don't let me down, don't let me down.


Don't pass me by

I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock dear
On my old front door
I don't hear it
Does it mean you don't love me any more.

I hear the clock a’ticking
On the mantel shelf
See the hands a’moving
But I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight 
And why I'm by myself
I don't see you 
Does it mean you don't love me any more.

Don't pass me by don't make me cry don't make me blue
'Cause you know darling I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so 
How I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by don’t make me cry

I'm sorry that I doubted you
I was so unfair
You were in a car crash
And you lost your hair
You said you would be late
About an hour or two
I said that's alright I'm waiting here
Just waiting to hear from you.

Eleanor Rigby

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong ?

Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near. 
Look at him working. Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?


Every little thing

When I'm walking beside her
People tell me I'm lucky.
Yes, I know I’m a lucky guy.
I remember the first time
I was lonely without her.
Can't s thinking about her now.
Every little thing she does,
She does for me, yeah.
And you know the things she does,
She does for me, oooh.
When I'm with her I'm happy
Just to know that she loves me.
Yes, I know that she loves me now.
There is one thing I'm sure of,
I will love her forever.
For I know love will never die.
Every little thing she does,
She does for me, yeah.
And you know the things she does,
She does for me, oooh.
Every little thing she does,

Everybody's got something to hide except me and my monkey

Everybody's trying to be my baby

Well they took some honey from the tree,
dressed it up and they called it me.
Everybody's trying to be my baby, everybody's trying to be my baby,
Everybody's trying to be my baby now.

Woke up last night, half past four,
Wicked woman knocking at my door.

Went out last night, I didn't stay late,
Called her home, had a nice teen date.


Fixing a hole

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where will it go
I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where will it go
And it really doesn’t matter if I'm wrong
I'm right
Where I belong I’m right
Where I belong.
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don’t get in my door.
I'm painting my room in the colourful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go.
And it really doesn't matter if
I'm wrong I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong.
Silly people run around they worry me
And never ask me why they don't get past my door.
I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren’t important yesterday
And I still go.
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And ss my mind from wandering
Where it will go.


For no one

Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all the words of kindness linger on 
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesn’t feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her when she said her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone
She doesn't need him

Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be time when all the things she said will fil your head
You won't forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years!


For you blue

Queen says no to pot smoking FBI members]

Because you're sweet and lovely girl I love you,
Because you're sweet and lovely girl it's true,
I love you more than ever girl I do.
I want you in the morining girl I love you,
I want you at the moment I feel blue,
I'm living ev'ry moment girl for you.
I've loved you from the moment I saw you,
You looked at me 'all you had to do,
I feel it now I hope you feel it too.
Because you're sweet and lovely girl I love you,
Because you're sweet and lovely girl it's true,
I love you more than ever girl I do.
I really love you.


Free as a bird

Free As A Bird,
It's the next best thing to be 
Free as a bird.
Home
Home and dry
Like a homing bird I fly,

Whatever happened to the life that we once knew
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so....

Sweet Loretta Fat thought she was a cleaner but she was a frying pan.]

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it wouldn't last.
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass.

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Jojo. Go home

Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged

Getting better

It's getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school
The teachers who taught me weren't cool
You're holding me down, turning me round
Filling me up with your rules.

I've got to admit it's getting better
A little better all the time
I have to admit it's getting better
It's getting better since you've been mine.

Me used to be a angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word
I finally heard
I’m doing the best that I can.
I’ve got to admit it's getting better
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can.

I admit it's getting better
A little better all the time
Yes I admit it's getting better
It's getting better since you've been mine.


Girl

Is there anybody gone to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl you want so much
It makes you sorry;
Still, you don't regret a single day.
Ah girl! Girl!

She's the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there, you feel a fool.
Didididi..
When you say she's looking good
She acts as if it's understood.
She's cool, cool, cool, cool,
Girl! Girl! [Was she]

When I think of all the times I’ve tried to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry;
And she promises the earth to me
And I believe her.
After all this times I don’t know why.
Ah, girl! Girl!

She's the kind of girl who puts you down when friends are there,
You feel a fool.
When you say sh'’s looking good, she acts as if it’s understood.
She's cool, cool, cool, cool, Girl! Girl!

Was she told when she was young the pain
Would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn
His day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he’s dead?
Ah girl! Girl! Girl!


Glass onion

I told you about strawberry fields
You know the place where nothing is real
Well here's another place you can go
Where everything flows.
Looking through the bent backed tulips
To see how the other half live
Looking through a glass onion.
I told you about the walrus and me-man
You know that we're as close as can be-man
Well here's another clue for you all
The walrus was Paul.
Standing on the cast iron shore-yeah
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meet-yeah
Looking through a glass onion.

I told you about the fool on the hill
I tell you man he living there still
Well here's another place you can be
Listen to me.
Fixing a hole in the ocean 
Trying to make a dove-tail joint-yeah
Looking through a glass onion.


Golden slumbers

Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullabye

Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles awake you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullabye

Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullabye


Good day sunshine

Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine

I need to laugh and when the sun is out
I've got something I can laugh about
I feel good in a special way
I'm in love and it’s a sunny day

Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine

We take a walk, the sun is shining down
Burns my feet as they touch the ground

Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine

Then we'd lie beneath the shady tree
I love her and she's loving me
She feels good, she knows she's looking fine
I'm so proud to know that she is mine.

Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine, Good Day Sunshine


Good morning, good morning

Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day how's your boy been
Nothing to do it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it’s O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
Going to work don't want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep.
And you're on your own you're in the street
Good morning, good morning...
After a while you start to smile now you feel cool.
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school.
Nothing has changed it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's O.K.
Good morning, good morning...
People running round it's five o’clock.
Everywhere in town is getting dark.
Everyone you see is full of life.
It's time for tea and meet the wife.
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here.
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now you're in gear.
Go to a show you hope she goes.
I've got nothing to say but it's O.K.
Good morning, good morning...


Good night

Now it's time to say good night 
Good night Sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night Sleep tight
Now the moon begins to shine
Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night Sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night Sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you.

Good night Good night Everybody
Everybody everywhere
Good night.


Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride, 
I didn’t know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you 
Every single day of my life

You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time we'd meet again
For I had told you

Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you hear me
Say we'll be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be, 
When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true I'll never leave 
And if I do I know the way there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you 
Every single day of my life

Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride, 
I didn’t know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Then suddenly I see you,
Did I tell you I need you...


Happiness is a warm gun

She's not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do do do 
She's well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane.

The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the Nation Trust.

I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix cause I'm going down
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun.

Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
When I hold you in my arms
And I feel my finger on your trigger
I know no one can do me no harm
Because happiness is a warm gun
-Yes it is.

Help!

Help, I need somebody,
Help, not just anybody,
Help, you know I need someone, help.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,
I never needed anybody's help in any way.
But now these days are gone, I’m not so self assured,
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors.

Help me if you can, I’m feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Won't you please, please help me.

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
My independence seems to vanish in the haze.
But every now and then I feel so insecure,
I know that I just need you like I've never done before.

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round.
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,
Won't you please, please help me.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,

Helter skelter

When I get to the bottom I go back to the  of the slide
Where I s and I turn and I go for a ride
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again.

Do you, don't you want me to love you

Tell me tell me tell me come on tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer.
Helter skelter helter skelter
Helter skelter.

Her Majesty

Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl,
but she doesn't have a lot to say
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
but she changes from day to day

I want to tell her that I love her a lot
But I gotta get a bellyful of wine
Her Majesty’s a pretty nice girl
Someday I'm going to make her mine, oh yeh,
someday I'm going to make her mine.


Here comes the sun

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say it's all right

Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say it's all right

Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say it's all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...

Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
And I say it's all right
It's all right


Here, there, and everywhere

To lead a better life I need my love to be here...

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

To be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere


Hey bulldog

Sheepdog
Standing in the rain,
Bullfrog
Doing it again
Some think that happinness is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears

Child-like
No one understands,
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands,
Some think that happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're something special when you smile

You can talk to me, if you’re lonely you can talk to me

Big man
Walking in the park
Whigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you haven't got a clue

You can talk to me, if you’re lonely you can talk to me


Hey Jude

Hey Jude, don't make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

Hey Jude, don't be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.

Hey Jude, don't let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
You're waiting for someone to perform with.
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do,
The movement you need is on your shoulder.

Hey Jude, don't make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin,
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh.
Naaa na na nananana, nanananaaa hey Jude...

Honey don’t

Well how can you say you will when you won't,
Say you do, baby, when you don’t?

Tell the truth now, is love real?

But oh well honey don't, well honey don't,
Honey don't, honey don't, honey don't
I say you will when you won’t, oh honey, don’t.

Well I love you, baby, and you ought to know
I like the way you wear your clothes,
Everything about you is so doggone sweet,
You got that sand all over your feet.

[Oh, rock on George, one time for me.]
[I feel fine.]
[I'm sad.]

Well sometimes I love you on a Saturday night,
Sunday morning you don't look right.
You've been out painting the town,
uh baby, been stepping around.

[Oh, rock on George, for Ringo one time.]


Honey pie

She was a working girl
North of England way
Now she's hit the big time
In the U.S.A.
And if she could only hear me
This is what I'd say.

Honey pie you are making me crazy 
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home.

Oh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
of your Hollywood song.

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee.

Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong.

Will the wind that blew her boat 
Across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home.

I don’t want to spoil the party

I don’t want to spoil the party so I'll go,
I would hate my disappointment to show,
There's nothing for me here so I will disappear,
If she turns up while I'm gone please let me know.

I've had a drink or two and I don't care,
There's no fun in what I do if she’s not there,
I wonder what went wrong I've waited far too long,
I think I'll take a walk and look for her.

Though tonight she's made me sad,
I still love her,
If I find her I'll be glad,
I still love her.

Love you all the time and never leave you.
Please come on back to me. I'm lonely as can be. I need you.
Said you had a thing or two to tell me. 
How was I to know you would upset me?
I didn't realize as I looked in your eyes...
You told me, oh yes, you told me, you don’t want my lovin' anymore.
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this I just can't go on anymore.
Please remember how I feel about you, I could never really live without you,
So, come on back and see just what you mean to me. I need you.


I saw her standing there

1 - 2 - 3 - 4 ! 

Well, she was just 17,
You know what I mean,
And the way she looked was way beyond compare.
So how could I dance with another (ooh) 
When I saw her standin' there.

Well she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long I'd fall in love with her.
She wouldn't dance with another (whooh)
When I saw her standin' there.

Well, my heart went ''boom,''
When I crossed that room,
And I held her hand in mine...

Whoah, we danced through the night,
And we held each other tight,
And before too long I fell in love with her.
Now I'll never dance with another (whooh)
Since I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went ''boom,''
When I crossed that room,
And I held her hand in mine...

Since I saw her standing there

Would love everything that you do; and I do, hey, hey, hey, and I do.

Only happen to me; can't you see, can't you see,
That when I tell you that I love you, oh, you're gonna say
You love me too, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, oh,
And when I ask you to be mine, you're gonna say you love me
Too. You love me too, you love me too.

I want to hold your hand

Oh yeah, I'll tell you something,
I think you'll understand.
When I'll say that something
I want to hold your hand,
I want to hold your hand,
I want to hold your hand.

Oh please, say to me
You'll let me be your man
And please, say to me
You'll let me hold your hand.
Now let me hold your hand,
I want to hold your hand.

And when I touch you I feel happy inside.
It's such a feeling that my love
I can't hide, I can't hide, I can't hide.

Yeah, you've got that something,
I think you'll understand.
When I'll say that something

I want to hold your hand,
I want to hold your hand


I want to tell you

I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When you're here
All those words, they seem to slip away

When I get near you,
The games begin to drag me down
It's all right
I'll make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
It's only me, it’s not my mind
That is confusing things.

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I don't know why,
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well,
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe you'd understand

I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I don't know why,
I don’t mind
I could wait forever, I've got time, I've got time, I've got time


I want you (she's so heavy)

I want you
so bad
it's driving me mad

She's so heavy


I will

Who knows how long I've loved you
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime
If you want me to--I will.

For if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name 
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same.

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart.

And when at last I find you 
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
You know I will
I will.


I'll be back

You know if you break my heart I'll go, but I'll be back
Again, 'cause I told you once before goodbye, but I came back again.
I love you so oh I'm the one who wants you, yes, I'm the one
Who wants you, oh ho, oh ho, oh
You could find better things to do, than to break my
Heart again, this time I will try to show that I'm not trying to pretend.
I thought that you would realize that if I ran away from you that you would want
Me too, but I've got a big surprise, oh ho, oh ho, oh
You could find better things to do, than to break my
Heart again, this time I will try to show that I'm not trying to pretend.
I wanna go but I hate to leave you, you know I hate to leave you, oh ho,
Oh ho, oh
You, if you break my heart I'll go, but I'll be back again.


I'll cry instead

I’ve got every reason on earth to be mad, 'cause I've just
Lost the only girl I had. If I could get my way, I'd get
Myself locked up today, but I can't so I cry instead.
I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet, I
Can't talk to people that I meet. If I could see you now,
I'd try to make you sad somehow, but I can't so I cry instead.
Don't want to cry when there's people there, I get shy when
They start to stare, I'm gonna hide myself away, ay hay;
But I'll come back again someday.
And when I do you’d better hide all the girls, I'm gonna
Break their hearts all 'round the world. Yes, I'm gonna
Break them in two, and show you what your loving man can
Do, until then I'll cry instead.


I'll follow the sun

One day you'll look to see I've gone.
For tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun.
Some day you'll know I was the one.
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun.
And now the time has come
And so my love I must go.

Oh yeh, oh yeh.


I'm a loser

I'm a loser
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won or have lost
there is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realize I have left it too late
And so it's true, pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be


I’m down

You telling lies thinking I can't see
You don't cry 'cos you're laughing at me
I'm down (I’m really down)
I'm down (Down on the ground)
I'm down (I’m really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down
(How can you laugh) When you know I'm down.

Man buys ring woman throws it away
Same damn thing happens everyday
I'm down (I'm really down)
I'm down (Down on the ground)
I'm down (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down
(How can you laugh) When you know I'm down.

We're all alone and there's nobody else
You still moan: ''Keep your hands to yourself!''
I'm down (I'm really down)
I'm down (Down on the ground)
I'm down (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down
(How can you laugh) When you know I'm down.

Don't you know that I'm down (I'm really down)
Don't you know that I'm down (I'm really down)
Down on the ground (I'm really down)
Don't you know that I'm down (I'm really down)
Down, down, down.


I'm just happy to dance with you

Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me
I don't want or need to hold your hand
Well it's only try and understand
'cause there's really nothing I would rather do
'cause I'm happy just to dance with you

I don't need to kiss or hold you tight
I just want to dance with you all night
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
'cause I’m happy just to dance with you
Just to dance with you
It's everything I need

Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me

Just to dance with you
It's everything I need

Before this dance is through

I’m looking through you

I’m looking through you, where did you go 
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You don’t look different, but you have changed 
I’m looking through you, you’re not the same 

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words aren’t clear
You don’t sound differnt, I’ve learned the game.
I’m looking through you, you’re not the same

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right? 
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight 

You’re thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is you’re down there
I’m looking through you, any other way

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right? 
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight 

I’m looking through you, where did you go 
I thought I knew you, what did I know 
You don’t look different, but you have changed
I’m looking through you, you’re not the same


I’m only sleeping

When I wake up early in the morning

Lift my head, I’m still yawning
When I’m in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, don’t wake me, no, don’t shake me
Leave me where I am - I’m only sleeping

Everybody seems to think I’m lazy
I don’t mind, I think they’re crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there’s no need (there’s no need)

Please, don’t spoil my day, I’m miles away
And after all I’m only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling...

Please, don’t spoil my day, I’m miles away
And after all I’m only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I’m still yawning
When I’m in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please, don’t wake me, no, don’t shake me
Leave me where I am - I’m only sleeping


I’m so tired

I’m so tired, I haven’t slept a wink
I’m so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No,no,no.

I’m so tired I don’t know what to do
I’m so tired my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what you’d do

You’d say I’m putting you on 
But it’s no joke, it’s doing me harm
You know I can’t sleep, I can’t s my brain
You know it’s three weeks, I’m going insane
You know I’d give you everything I’ve got 
for a little peace of mind

I’m so tired, I’m feeling so upset
Although I’m so tired I’ll have another cigarette 
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid guest.


I’ve got a feeling

I’ve got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
I’ve got a feeling, a feeling I can’t hide
Oh no. Oh no, Oh no,
Yeah I’ve got a feeling.

Oh please believe me, I’d hate to miss the train
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
And if you leave me I won’t be late again
Oh no, Oh no, Oh no.
Yeah I’ve got a feeling yeah.

All these years I’ve been wandering around,
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you.

Ev’rybody had a hard year
Ev’rybody had a good time
Ev’rybody had a wet dream,
Ev’rybody saw the sunshine
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Ev’rybody had a good year,
Ev’rybody let their hair down,
Ev’rybody pulled their socks up,
Ev’rybody put their foot down.
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.

[Oh my soul... so odd.]


I’ve just seen a face

I’ve just seen a face,
I can’t forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
She’s just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
We’ve met, mmm-mmm-mmm-m’mmm-mmm.
Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I’d have never been aware.
But as it is I’ll dream of her
Tonight, di-di-di-di’n’di.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
I have never known
The like of this, I’ve been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, da-da-n’da-da’n’da.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
I’ve just seen a face,
I can’t forget the time or place
Where we just meet.
She’s just the girl for me
And want all the world to see
We’ve met, mmm-mmm-mmm-da-da-da.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.
Oh, falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.


If I fell

If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
‘cause I’ve been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

If I trust in you oh please
Don’t run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Don’t hurt my pride like her
‘cause I couldn’t stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

If I fell in love with you


If I needed someone

If I needed someone to love
You’re the one that I’d be thinking of
If I needed someone

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I’d be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day 
It might not have been like this
But you see now I’m too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I’d be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day 
It might not have been like this
But you see now I’m too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah


In my life

There are places I’ll remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I’ve loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I’ll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I’ll often s and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know I’ll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I’ll often s and think about them
In my life I love you more
In my life I love you more


It won’t be long

Ev’ry night when ev’rybody has fun,
Here am I sitting all on my own,
It won’t be long yeh, yeh,
It won’t be long yeh, yeh,
It won’t be long yeh, yeh,
Till I belong to you.

Since you left me I’m so alone,
Now you’re coming, you’re coming home,
I’ll be good like I know I should,
You’re coming home, you’re coming home.

Ev’ry night the tears come down from my eyes,
Ev’ry day I’ve done nothing but cry.
It won’t be long yeh, yeh.

Since you left me I’m so alone,
Now you’re coming, you’re coming home,
I’ll be good like I know I should,
You’re coming home, you’re coming home.

Ev’ry day we’ll be happy, I know,
Now I know that you won’t leave me no more.
It won’t be long yeh, yeh.


It’s all too much

It’s all too much, It’s all too much 

When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see 

It’s all too much for me to take
The love that’s shining all around you
Everywhere, it’s what you make
For us to take, it’s all too much 

Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where you’d like to be 

It’s all too much for me to take
The love that’s shining all around here
All the world’s a birthday cake,
So take a piece but not too much 

Set me on a silver sun, for I know that I’m free
Show me that I’m everywhere, and get me home for tea 

It’s all to much for me to see
A love that’s shining all around here
The more I am, the less I know
And what I do is all too much 

It’s all too much for me to take
The love that’s shining all around you
Everywhere, it’s what you make
For us to take, it’s all too much 

It’s too much.....It’s too much 

Too much too much too much (fade to end)


It’s only love

I get high when I see you go by
My oh my.
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies,
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when I’m beside you?
It’s only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
It’s only love, and that is all,
But it’s so hard loving you.

Is it right that you and I should fight
Ev’ry night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright,
Very bright.
Haven’t I the right to make it up girl?
It’s only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
It’s only love, and that is all
But it’s so hard loving you
Yes it’s so hard loving you -- loving you.


Julia

Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you, Julia

Julia, Julia, oceanchild, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering,
In the sun

Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia

Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Hum hum hum hum...calls me
So I sing a song of love for Julia, Julia, Julia


Komm, gib mir deine Hand

Oh, komm doch,
Komm zu mir,
Du nimmst mir den Verstand.
Oh, komm doch,
Komm zu mir,
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.

Oh, du bist so schön,
Schön wie ein Diamant,
Ich will mit dir gehen,
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.
Komm gib mir deine Hand.

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh;
Das war noch nie bei einer andern
Einmal so.
Einmal so.
Einmal so.

Oh, komm doch, . . .

In deinen Armen bin ich glücklich und froh; . . .

Oh, du bist so schön, . . .


Lady Madonna

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.
Who finds the money? When you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

Friday night arrives without a suitcase.
Sunday morning creep in like a nun.
Monday’s child has learned to tie his bootlace.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast.
Wonder how you manage to feed the rest.

See how they run.
Lady Madonna, lying on the bed,
Listen to the music playing in your head.

Tuesday afternoon is never ending.
Wednesday morning papers didn’t come.
Thursday night you stockings needed mending.
See how they run.

Lady Madonna, children at your feet.
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.


Let it be

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, Let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be.

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, Yeah
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper Words of Wisdom, Let it be

And when the night is cloudy,
There is still a light that shines on me,
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.


Little child

Little child, little child,
Little child, won’t you dance with me?

Baby take a chance with me.

If you want someone
To make you feel so fine,
Then we’ll have some fun
When you’re mine, all mine,
So come, come on, come on.

Little child, little child,
Little child, won’t you dance with me?
I’m so sad and lonely,
Baby take a chance with me.

When you’re by my side,
You’re the only one,
Don’t run and hide,
Just come on, come on,
So come on, come on, come on.

Long, long, long

It’s been a long long long time,
How could I ever have lost you
When I loved you.

It took a long long long time
Now I’m so happy I found you
How I love you

So many tears I was searching,
So many tears I was wasting, oh. Oh--

Now I can see you, be you
How can I ever misplace you
How I want you
Oh I love you
Your know that I need you.
Ooh I love you.

Love you to

Each day just goes so fast
I turn around - it’s past
You don’t time to hang a sign on me

Love me while you can
Before I’m dead old man

A lifetime is so short
A new one can’t be bought
And what you’ve got means such a lot to me

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

There’s people standing round
Who screw you in the ground
They’ll fill your head with all the things you see

I’ll make love to you
If you want me too


Lovely Rita

Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Lovely Rita meter maid.
Nothing can come between us,
When it gets dark I tow your heart away.
Standing by a parking meter,
When I caught a glimpse of Rita,
Filling in a ticket in her little white book.
In a cap she looked much older,
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man.
Lovely Rita meter maid,
May I inquire discreetly,
When are you free,
To take some tea with me.
Took her out and tried to win her,
Had a laugh and over dinner,
Told her I would really like to see her again,
Got the bill and Rita paid it,
Took her home I nearly made it,
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two.
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid,
Where would I be without you,
Give us a wink and make me think of you.


Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds

Picture yourself in a boat on a river,
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green,
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,
And she’s gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies,
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers,
That grow so incredibly high.
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
Waiting to take you away.
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,
And you’re gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Picture yourself on a train in a station,
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle,
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes.


Maggie Mae

Oh dirty Maggie Mae they have taken her away
And she never walk down Lime Street any more
Oh the judge he guilty found her
For robbing a homeward bounder
That dirty no good robbin’ Maggie Mae
To the port of Liverpool
They returned me to
Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay

Maxwell’s silver hammer

Joan was quizzical, studied metaphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test-tube
Ohh-oh-oh-oh...
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
“Can I take you out to the pictures
Joa-oa-oa-oan?”
But as she’s getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door...

Bang, bang, Maxwell’s silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwell’s silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times “I must not be so-o-o-oo...”
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwell’s silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwell’s silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

B.C. Thirty-One said “we caught a dirty one”
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures ohh-oh-oh-oh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them so-o-o-oo
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwell’s silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Bang, Bang, Maxwell’s silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead


Mean Mr. Mustard

Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never ss, she’s a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that he’s ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man

Mother nature’s son

Born a poor young country boy--Mother Nature’s son
All day long I’m sitting singing songs for everyone.

Sit beside a mountain stream--see her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies.

Find me in my field of grass--Mother Nature’s son
Swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun.

Mother Nature’s son.


Mr. Moonlight

Mr. Moonlight
You came to me one summernight and from your beam you made my dream,
And from the world you sent my girl and from above you sent us love,
And now she’s mine.
I think you’re fine ‘cause we love you, Mr. Moonlight.

Mr. Moonlight, come again please, here I am on my knees,
Begging if you please, and the nights you don’t come my way.
I’ll pray and pray more each day, ‘cause we love you, Mr. Moonlight,
Mr. Moonlight.


No reply

This happened once before,
When I came to your door,
No reply.
They said it wasn’t you,
But I saw you peep through your window,
I saw the light, I saw the light,
I know that you saw me,
‘cos I looked up to see your face.

I tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
That’s a lie,
‘cause I know where you’ve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
‘cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

If I were you I’d realize that I
Love you more than any other guy,
And I’ll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply.

I’ve tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
That’s a lie,
‘cause I know where you’ve been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I nearly died, I nearly died,
‘cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.

No reply, no reply.


Norwegian wood

I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me...
She showed me her room, isn’t it good, norwegian wood?

She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere,
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn’t a chair.

I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine.
We talked until two and then she said, “It’s time for bed”

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.
I told her I didn’t and crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire, isn’t it good, norwegian wood.


Not a second time

You know you made me cry,
I see no use in wond’ring why,
I cried for you.

And now, you’ve changed your mind,
I see no reason to change mine,
I cried, it’s through, oh.

Oh, you’re giving me the same old line,
I’m wond’ring why,
You hurt me then, you’re back again,
No, no, not a second time.


Nowhere man

He’s a real nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans
for nobody.

Doesn’t kave a point of view,
Knows not where he’s going to,
Isn’t he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, please listen,
You don’t know what you’re missing,
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command.

He’s as blind as he can be,
Just sees what he wants to see,
Nowhere Man can you see me at all?
Doesn’t kave a point of view,
Knows not where he’s going to,
Isn’t he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, don’t worry,
Take your time, don’t hurry,
Leave it all till somebody else
lend you a hand.

He’s a real Nowhere Man,
Sitting in his Nowhere Land,
Making all his nowhere plans


Ob-la-di, ob-la-da

Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly-girl I like your face
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand. 
Obladi oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on
Obladi Oblada life goes on bra
Lala how the life goes on.

Desmond takes a trolly to the jewellers store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing.

In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard 
Of Desmond and Molly Jones.

Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening she’s a singer with the band.

And if you want some fun-take Obladi Oblada.


Ocus’s garden

I’d like to be under the sea
In an ocus’ garden in the shade
He’d let us in, knows where we’ve been
In his ocus’ garden in the shade

I’d ask my friends to come and see
An ocus’ garden with me
I’d like to be under the sea
In an ocus’ garden in the shade.

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an ocus’ garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
because we know we can’t be found
I’d like to be under the sea
In an ocus’ garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they’re happy and they’re safe
(Happy and they’re safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
I’d like to be under the sea
In an ocus’ garden with you.


Oh! Darling

Oh! Darling, please believe me
I’ll never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
I’ll never do you no harm

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I’ll never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Don’t ever leave me alone

When you told me you didn’t need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didn’t need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I’ll never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
I’ll never do you no harm

When you told me you didn’t need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didn’t need me anymore
Well you know I nearly broke down and died

Oh! Darling, please believe me
I’ll never let you down
Believe me when I tell you
I’ll never do you no harm


Old brown shoe

I want a love that’s right but right is only half of what’s wrong.
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long.
Now I’m stepping out this old brown shoe, baby, I’m in love with you.
I’m so glad you came here, it won’t be the same now, I’m telling you.

You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile replace every thoughtless frown.
Got me escaping from this zoo, baby, I’m in love with you.
I’m so glad you came here, it won’t be the same now when I’m with you.

If I grow up I’ll be a singer wearing rings on every finger.
Not worrying what they or you say I’ll live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.
I may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you can’t reject.
I’m changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.

That love of your, to miss that love is something I’d hate.
I’ll make an early start, I’m making sure that I’m not late.
For you sweet  lip I’m in the queue, baby, I’m in love with you.
I’m so glad you came here, it won’t be the same now when I’m with you.
I’m so glad you came here, it won’t be the same now when I’m with you.


One after 909

My baby says she’s trav’ling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I’m travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don’t be cold as ice.

I said I’m trav’ling on the one after 909 I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees,
You’re only fooling around, you’re fooling around with me.
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don’t be cold as ice.

I said I’m trav’ling on the one after 909
I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says you’ve got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find I’ve got the number wrong

Well I said I’m trav’ling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I’m travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don’t be cold as ice.

I said we’re trav’ling on the one after 9 0,
I said we’re trav’ling on the one after 9 0,
I said we’re trav’ling on the one after 909.
[“Danny Boy...”]


Only a northern song

If you’re listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they’re not;
He just wrote it like that.
It doesn’t really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it’s only a Northern song
It doesn’t really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it’s only a Northern song.
When you’re listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are, they just play it like that
It doesn’t really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it’s only a Northern song.
It doesn’t really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it’s only a Northern song.
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You’re correct, there’s nobody there.
It doesn’t really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
And I told you there’s no one there.

Penny Lane

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he’s had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
S and say hello.

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mack
In the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
It’s a clean machine.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And tho’ she feels as if she’s in a play
She is anyway.

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back.
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies,
Penny Lane.


Piggies

Have you seen the little piggies 
Crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in.

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in.

In their styes with all their backing
They don’t care what goes on around
In their eyes there’s something lacking
What they need’s a damn good whacking.

Everywhere there’s lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner 
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon.

Wait, oh yes wait a minute mister postman

Polythene pam

Well you should see Polythene Pam
She’s so good-looking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam.
Yeah yeah yeah

Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She’s killer-diller when she’s dressed to the hilt
She’s the kind of a girl that makes the “News of the World”
Yes you could say she was attractively built.


Rain

If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.
They might as well be dead.
If the rain comes, if the rain comes.
When the sun shines they slip into the shade
(When the sun shines down.)
And drink their lemonade.
(When the sun shines down.)
When the sun shines, when the sun shines.
Rain, I don’t mind.
Shine, the weather’s fine.
I can show you that when it starts to rain,
(When the sun shines down.)
Everything’s the same.
(When the sun shines down.)
I can show you, I can show you.
Rain, I don’t mind.
Shine, the weather’s fine.
Can you hear me, that when it rains and shines,
(When the sun shines down.)
It’s just a state of mind?
(When the sun shines down.)
Can you hear me, can you hear me?
If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.

Real love

All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dream
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for you

Don’t need to be alone
No need to be alone

It’s real love
It’s real, yes it’s real love
It’s real

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

Don’t need to be afraid
No need to be afraid

It’s real love
It’s real, yes it’s real love
It’s real

Thought I’d been in love before,
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Don’t need to be alone
No need to be alone

It’s real love
Yes it’s real, yes it’s real love
It’s real, yes it’s real love...


Revolution

You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it’s evolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don’t you know you can count me out
Don’t you know it’s gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say you got a real solution
Well you know
We’d all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
We’re doing what we can
But when you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait
Don’t you know it’s gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say you’ll change the constitution
Well you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me it’s the institution
Well you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You ain’t going to make it with anyone anyhow
Don’t you know know it’s gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

Alright!

Rock and roll music

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It’s got a back beat, you can’t lose it,
Any old time you use it
It’s gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I’ve got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

That’s why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It’s got a back beat, you can’t lost it,
Any old time you use it
It’s gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over ‘cross the tracks
So she can hear my man a’wail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin’ band
Man, they were goin’ like a hurricane

That’s why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It’s got a back beat, you can’t lost it,
Any old time you use it
It’s gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They’re drinkin’ home brew from a water cup
The folks dancin’ got all shook up

And started playin’ that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It’s got a back beat, you can’t lost it,
Any old time you use it
It’s gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Don’t care to hear ‘em play a tango
I’m in the mood to gear a mambo
It’s way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin’ that piano
So I can gear some of that

Rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It’s got a back beat, you can’t lost it,
Any old time you use it
It’s gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me


Rocky raccoon

Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didn’t like that
He said I’m gonna get that boy
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon.

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon’s bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy.
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy.
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said Danny boy this is a showdown
But Daniel was hot-he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner.

Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said Rocky you met your match
And Rocky said, Doc it’s only a scratch
And I’ll be better I’ll be better doc as soon as I am able.

Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon’s bible
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky’s revival.


Roll over Beethoven

Well gonna write a little letter
Gonna mail it to my local D.J.
It’s a rockin’ little record 
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven 
I gotta hear it again today

You know my temperature’s risin’
And the jukebox’s blowin’ a fuse
My hearts beatin’ rhythm 
And my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven 
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

I got a rockin’ pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I think I got it off the writer
Sittin’ down by the rhythm review
Roll over Beethoven
We’re rockin’ in two by two

Well if you fell you like it
Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just jump around and reel and rock it

Don’t you step on my blue suede showes
Hey little little
Gonna play my fiddle
Ain’t got nothing to lost
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

Dance like a spinnin’ 
She got a crazy partner
Oughta see ‘em reel an rock
Long as she’s got a dime
The music will never s
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
And dig these rhythm and blues


Run for your life

Well I’d rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man

Of I won’t know where I am

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man 
That’s the end’a little girl

And I was born with a jealous mind
And I can’t spend my whole life
Trying just to make you toe the line

Catch you with another man 
That’s the end’a little girl

Catch you with another man
That’s the end’a little girl

Savoy truffle

Creme tangerine and montelimat
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
A coffee dessert--yes you know it’s good news
But you’ll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle.

Cool cherry cream and a nice apple tart
I feel your taste all the time we’re apart
Coconut fudge--really blows down those blues
But you’ll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle.

You might not feel it now 
But when the pain cuts through
You’re going to know and how 
The sweat is going to fill your head
When it becomes too much
You’re going to shout aloud
--Creme tangerine.

You know that what you eat you are,
But what is sweet now, turns so sour--
We all know Obla-Di-Bla-Da
But can you show me, where you are?..

Creme tangerine and montelimat
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
A coffee dessert--yes you know its good news
But you’ll have to have them all pulled out

She came in through the bathroom window

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didn’t anybody tell her?
Didn’t anybody see?
Sunday’s on the phone to Monday,
Tuesday’s on the phone to me

She said she’d always been a dancer
She worked at 15 clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well I knew what I could not say.

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

Didn’t anybody tell her?
Didn’t anybody see?
Sunday’s on the phone to Monday,
Tuesday’s on the phone to me


She loves you

She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You think you lost your love,
When I saw her yesterday.
It’s you she’s thinking of
And she told me what to say.
She says she loves you
And you know that can’t be bad.
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad. Ooh!

She said you hurt her so
She almost lost her mind.
She said to let you know
You’re not the hurting kind.
She says she loves you
And you know that can’t be bad.
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad. Ooh!

She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
And with a love like that
You know you should be glad.

And now it’s up to you,
I think it’s only fair,
Pride can hurt you, too,
Apologize to her
Because she loves you
And you know that can’t be bad.
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad. Ooh!

She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
And with a love like that
You know you should be glad.
With a love like that
You know you should be glad.
With a love like that, 
You know you sho-o-ould
Be Glad!
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah Ye-ah.


She said, she said

She said I know what it’s like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And she’s making me feel like I’ve never been born.

I said “Who put all those things in your hair
Things that make me feel that I’m mad
And you’re making me feel like I’ve never been born.”

She said “you don’t understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, you’re wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that I’m ready to leave
‘Cause you’re making me feel like I’ve never been born.”

She said “you don’t understand what I said”
I said “No, no, no, you’re wrong”
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right

I said “Even though you know what you know
I know that I’m ready to leave
‘Cause you’re making me feel like I’ve never been born.”

She said I know what it’s like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad...


She’s a woman

My love don’t give me presents.
I know that she’s no peasant,
Only ever has to give me love forever and forever,
My love don’t give me presents,
Turn me on when I get lonely,
People tell me that she’s only
Foolin’, I know she isn’t.

She don’t give the boys the eye,
She hates to see me cry,
She is happy just to hear me say
That I will never leave her.
She don’t give the boys the eye,
She will never make me jealous,
Gives me all her time as well as lovin’,
Don’t ask me why.

She’s a woman who understands.
She’s a woman who loves her man.

She’s a woman, she’s a woman.


She’s leaving home

Wednesday morning at five o’clock as the day begings
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her hankerchief
Quietly turing the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free.
She (We gave her most of our lives)
is leaving (Sacraficed most of our lives)
home (We gave her everything money could buy)
She’s leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that’s lying there
Standing alone at the  of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy our baby’s gone.
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me.
She (We never though of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She’s leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Friday morning at nine o’clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade.
She What did we do that was wrong
Is having We didn’t know it was wrong
Fun Fun is the one thing that money can’t buy
Something inside that was always denied
For so many years. Bye, Bye


Sie liebt dich

Sie liebt dich
Sie liebt dich
Sie liebt dich

Du glaubst sie liebt nur mich?
Gestern hab’ ich sie gesehen.
Sie denkt ja nur an dich,
Und du solltest zu ihr gehen.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich.
Schöner kann es gar nicht sein.
Ja, sie liebt dich,
Und da solltest du dich freu’n.

Du hast ihr weh getan,
Sie wusste nicht warum.
Du warst nicht schuld daran,
Und drehtest dich nicht um.

Oh, ja sie liebt dich. . . .

Sie liebt dich
Sie liebt dich
Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.

Du musst jetzt zu ihr gehen,
Entschuldigst dich bei ihr.
Ja, das wid sie verstehen,
Und dann verzeiht sie dir.

Sie liebt dich
Sie liebt dich
Denn mit dir allein kann sie nur glücklich sein.


Slow down

Well, come on pretty baby, won’t you walk with me?
Come on, pretty baby, won’t you talk with me?
Come on pretty baby, give me one more chance.
Try to save our romance!

Slow down, baby, now you’re movin’ way too fast.
You gotta gimme little lovin’, gimme little lovin’,
Ow! if you want our love to last.

Well, I used to walk you home, baby, after school,
Carry your books home, too.
But now you got a boyfriend down the street,
Baby what you’re tryin’ to do?

You better slow down!
Baby, now you’re movin’ way too fast.
You gotta gimme little lovin’, gimme little lovin’,
Bbbbb! if you want our love to last.

Well you know that I love you, tell the world I do.
Come on, pretty baby, why can’t you be true?
I need your baby, oh so bad,
The best little woman I ever had

Slow down, baby, now you’re movin’ way too fast.
You gotta gimme little lovin’, gimme little lovin’,
Ow! if you want our love to last.


Something

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

I don’t want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don’t need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

Don’t want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

You’re asking me will my love grow
I don’t know, I don’t know
You stick around now it may show
I don’t know, I don’t know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

Don’t want to leave her now
You know I believe her now


Strawberry fields forever

Let me take you down, ‘cause I’m going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see.
It’s getting hard to be someone but it all works out, it doesn’t matter much to me.
Let me take you down, ‘cause I’m going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low.
That is you can’t you know tune in but it’s all right, that is I think it’s not too bad.
Let me take you down, ‘cause I’m going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.

Always, no sometimes, think it’s me, but you know I know when it’s a dream.
I think I know I mean a ‘Yes’ but it’s all wrong, that is I think I disagree.
Let me take you down, ‘cause I’m going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.
Strawberry Fields forever.


Sun king

Italian lyrics broken down phoenetically]
Here comes the sun king
Here comes the sun king
Everybody’s laughing
Everybody’s happy
Here comes the sun king

Quando paramucho mi amore de felice carathon
Mundo paparazzi mi amore cicce verdi parasol
Questo abrigado tantamucho que canite carousel


Taxman

Let me tell you how it will be
There’s one for you, nineteen for me
‘Cause I’m the taxman, yeah, I’m the taxman

Should five per cent appear too small
Be thankful I don’t take it all
‘Cause I’m the taxman, yeah I’m the taxman

If you drive a car, I’ll tax the street,
If you try to sit, I’ll tax your seat.
If you get too cold I’ll tax the heat,
If you take a walk, I’ll tax your feet.

Don’t ask me what I want it for
If you don’t want to pay some more
‘Cause I’m the taxman, yeah, I’m the taxman

Now my advice for those who die
Declare the pennies on your eyes
‘Cause I’m the taxman, yeah, I’m the taxman
And you’re working for no one but me.


Tell me what you see

If you let me take your heart I will prove to you,
We will never be apart if I’m part of you.
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away.
If you put your trust in me I’ll make bright your day.
Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see.
Don’t you realise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Can’t you try to see that I’m trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.
Tell me what you see.
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Can’t you try to see that I’m trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see.
It is no suprise now, what you see is me.


Tell me why

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I gave you ev’rything I had,
But you left me sitting on my own,
Did you have to treat me oh so bad,
All I do is hang my head and moan.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

If there’s something I have said or done,
Tell me what and I’ll apologize,
If you don’t really can’t go on,
Holding back these tears in my eyes.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.

Well I beg you on my bended knees,
If you’ll only listen to my pleas,
Is there anything I can do,
‘cause I really can’t stand it, I’m so in love with you.

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.


Thank you girl

Oh, oh,
You’ve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally I’ll always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love,
I know little girl,
Only a fool would doubt our love,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Thank you girl for loving me
The way that you do, (way that you do),
That’s the kind of love
That is too good to be true,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.

Oh, oh,
You’ve been good to me,
You made me glad
When I was blue,
And eternally I’ll always be
In love with you,
And all I gotta do
Is thank you girl, thank you girl.


The ballad of John and Yoko

Standing in the dock at Southampton,
Trying to get to Holland or France.
The man in the mac said, “You’ve got to turn back”.
You know they didn’t even give us a chance.
Christ you know it ain’t easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
They’re going to crucify me.
Finally made the plane into Paris,
Honey mooning down by the Seine.
Peter Brown called to say,
“You can make it O.K.,
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain”.
Christ you know it ain’t easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
They’re going to crucify me.
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton,
Talking in our beds for a week.
The newspapers said, “Say what you doing in bed?”
I said, “We’re only trying to get us some peace”.
Christ you know it ain’t easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
They’re going to crucify me.
Saving up your money for a rainy day,
Giving all your clothes to charity.
Last night the wife said,
“Oh boy, when you’re dead
You don’t take nothing with you
But your soul - think!”
Made a lightning trip to Vienna,
eating chocolate cake in a bag.
The newspapers said, “She’s gone to his head,
They look just like two gurus in drag”.
Christ you know it ain’t easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
They’re going to crucify me.
Caught an early plane back to London.
Fifty acorns tied in a sack.
The men from the press said, “We wish you success,
It’s good to have the both of you back”.
Christ you know it ain’t easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going
They’re going to crucify me.
The way things are going
They’re going to crucify me.


The continuing story of Bungalow Bill

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom
He’s the all American bullet-headed saxon mother’s son.
All the children sing

Hey Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped in right between the eyes
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill 
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
Not when he looked so fierce, his mother butted in 
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?


The end

Oh yeah, all right
Are you going to be in my dreams
Tonight?

And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make.


The fool on the hill

Day after day alone on the hill,
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that he’s just a fool, 
And he never gives an answer,
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.

Well on his way his head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices talking percetly loud
But nobody ever hears him,
Or the sound he appears to make,
And he never seems to notice,
But the fool on the hill . . .
Nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do.
And he never shows his feelings,
But the fool on the hill . . .


The inner light

Without going out of my door
I can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
I could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Without going out of my door
You can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
You could know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doing


The long and winding road that leads to your door,
Will never disappear,
I’ve seen that road before It always leads me here,
Leads me to your door.

The wild and windy night the rain washed away,
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day.
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way
Many times I’ve been alone and many times I’ve cried
Anyway you’ll never know the many ways I’ve tried, but
Still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don’t leave me waiting here, lead me to you door
Da, da, da, da--


The night before

We said our goodbyes, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

We said our goodbye, ah, the night before.
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before.
Now today I find you have changed your mind.
Treat me like you did the night before.

When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before.

Last night is a night I will remember you by.
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry.

Were you telling lies, ah, the night before?
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before?
When I held you near you were so sincere.
Treat me like you did the night before,
like the night before.


The word

Say the word and you’ll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I’m thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It’s so fine, It’s sunshine
It’s the word, love
In the beginning I misunderstood
But now I’ve got it, the word is good

Spread the word and you’ll be free
Spread the word and be like be
Spread the work I’m thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It’s so fine, It’s sunshine
It’s the word, love
Every where I go I hear it said
In the good and bad books that I have read

Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
It’s the word I’m thinking of
And the only word is love
It’s so fine, It’s sunshine
It’s the word, love
Now that I know what I feel must be right
I’m here to show everybody the light

Say the word and you’ll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I’m thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It’s so fine, It’s sunshine
It’s the word, love


There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And it’s my mind,
And there’s no time when I’m alone.

I think of you,
And things you do,
Go ‘round my head,
The things you said,
Like “I love only you.”

In my mind there’s no sorrow,
Don’t you know that it’s so.
There’ll be no sad tomorrow,
Don’t you know that it’s so.

There is a place,
Where I can go,
When I feel low,
When I feel blue.
And it’s my mind,
And there’s no time when I’m alone.

There’s a place...


Things we said today

You say you will love me
If I have to go.
You’ll be thinking of me,
Somehow I will know.
Someday when I’m lonely,
Wishing you weren’t so far away,
Then I will remember
The things we said today.
You say you’ll be mine, girl,
Until the end of time.
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find.
Someday when we’re dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Me, I’m just the lucky kind.
Love to hear you say that love is luck.
And, though we may be blind,
Love is here to stay. And that’s enough
To make you mine, girl,
Be the only one.
Love me all the time, girl.
We’ll go on and on.
Someday when we’re dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.
Love me all the time, girl.
We’ll go on and on.
Someday when we’re dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will tremember
The things we said today.


style='color:black;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Think for yourself

I’ve got a word or two
To say about the things that you do
You’re telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where you’re going to
Think for yourself
‘Cause I won’t be there with you 

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind
And though you still can’t see
I know your mind’s made up
You’re gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do
And go where you’re going to
Think for yourself
‘Cause I won’t be there with you

Although your mind’s opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And you’ve got time to rectify
All the things that you should

Do what you want to do
And go where you’re going to
Think for yourself
‘Cause I won’t be there with you

Do what you want to do
And go where you’re going to

This boy

That boy took my love away,
He’ll regret it someday,
But this boy wants you back again.

That boy...

[Take 12 breaks down here, then take 13 begins]

That boy took my love away,
He’ll regret it someday,
But this boy wants you back again.

That boy isn’t good for you,
Tho’ he may want you too,
This boy wants you back again.

Oh, and this boy would be happy,
Just to love you, buy oh my-yi-yi,
That boy won’t be happy,
Till he’s seen you cry-hi-hi.

This boy wouldn’t mind the pain,
Would always feel the same,
If this boy gets you back again.
This boy. This boy.


Ticket to ride

Till there was you

There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No I never heard them at all
Till there was you

There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No I never saw them at all
Till there was you

Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows of dawn and you

There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No I never heard it at all
Till there was you

Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows of dawn and you

There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No I never heard it at all
Till there was you

Till there was you


Tomorrow never knows

Turn off your mind, relax and float down stream,
It is not dying, it is not dying

Lay down al thoughts, surrender to the void,
It is shining, it is shining.

Yet you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being

Love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing

And ignorance and hate mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing

But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not leaving, it is not leaving

So play the game “Existence” to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning

Two of us

Two of us riding nowhere
Spending someone’s
Hard earned pay
Two of us Sunday driving
Not arriving
On our way back home
We’re on our way home
We’re on our way home
We’re going home

Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches
Lifting latches
On our way back home
We’re on our way home
We’re on our way home
We’re going home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing so low
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere
On our way back home
We’re on our way home
We’re on our way home
We’re going home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing so low
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere
On our way back home
We’re on our way home
We’re on our way home
We’re going home

We’re going home
Better believe it


Wait

It’s been a long time
Now I’m coming back home
I’ve been away now
Oh how I’ve been alone
Wait till I come back to your side
We’ll forget the tears we’ve cried

But if your heart breaks
Don’t wait, turn me away
And if your heart’s strong
Hold on, I won’t delay
Wait till I come back to your side
We’ll forget the tears we’ve cried

I feel as though
You ought to know
That I’ve been good
As good as I can be
And if you do
I’ll trust in you
And know that you
Will wait for me

It’s been a long time
Now I’m coming back home
I’ve been away now
Oh how I’ve been alone
Wait till I come back to your side
We’ll forget the tears we’ve cried

I feel as though
You ought to know
That I’ve been good
As good as I can be
And if you do
I’ll trust in you
And know that you
Will wait for me

It’s been a long time
Now I’m coming back home
I’ve been away now
Oh how I’ve been alone
Wait till I come back to your side
We’ll forget the tears we’ve cried

It’s been a long time
Now I’m coming back home
I’ve been away now
Oh, how I’ve been alone


We can work it out

Try to see it my way,
Do I have to keep on talking till I can’t go on?
While you see it your way,
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone.

We can work it out,
We can work it out.

Think of what you’re saying.
You can get it wrong and still you think that it’s alright.
Think of what I’m saying,
We can work it out and get it straight, or say good night.

We can work it out,
We can work it out.

Life is very short, and there’s no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend.
I have always thought that it’s a crime,
So I will ask you once again.

Try to see it my way,
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong.
While you see it your way
There’s a chance that we may fall apart before too long.

We can work it out,
We can work it out.

Life is very short, and there’s no time

While you see it your way
There’s a chance that we may fall apart before too long.
We can work it out,
We can work it out.


What goes on

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind

The other day I saw you
As I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you
I could feel my future fold
It’s so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind

I met you in the morning
waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning
I can see that I was blind
It’s so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?

I used to think of no on else
But you were just the same
You didn’t even think of me
As someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die
Tell me why

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind
In your mind
In your mind


What you’re doing

Look what you’re doing, I’m feeling blue and lonely,
Would it be too much to ask you,
What you’re doing to me?

You got me running and there’s no fun in it,
Why should it be so much to ask of you,
What you’re doing to me?

I’ve been waiting here for you,
Wond’ring what you’re gonna do,
Should you need a love that’s true,
It’s me.

Please s your lying, you’ve got me crying, girl,
Why should it be so much to ask of you,
What you’re doing to me?

What you’re doing to me.


When I get home

Whoa-ho, whoa-ho,
I got a whole lot of things to tell her,
When I get home.
Come on, out of my way,
‘cause I’m gonna see my baby today,
I’ve got a whole lot of things I’ve gotta say
To her.

Whoa-ho, whoa-ho,
I got a whole lot of things to tell her,
When I get home.
Come on if you please,
I’ve got no time for trivialities,
I’ve got a girl who’s waiting home for me tonight.

Whoa-ho, whoa-ho,
I got a whole lot of things to tell her,
When I get home.
When I’m getting home tonight, I’m gonna
Hold her tight.
I’m gonna love her till the cows come home,
I bet I’ll love her more,
Till I walk out that door
Again.

Come on, let me through,
I’ve got so many things, I’ve got to do,
I’ve got no business being here with you
This way.

Whoa-ho, whoa-ho,
I’ve got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home - yeah.


When I’m sixty-four

When I get older losing my hair,
Many years from now.
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings bottle of wine.
If I’d been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door,
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty-four.
You'll be older too,
And if you say the word,
I could stay with you.
I could be handy, mending a fuse
When your lights have gone.
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride,
Doing the garden, digging the weeds,
Who could ask for more.
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I’m sixty-four.
Every summer we can rent a cottage,
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera Chuck & Dave
Send me a postcard, drop me a line,
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I’m sixty-four.


While my guitar gently weeps

I look at you all see the love there that’s sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping 
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don’t know why nobody told you how to unfold your love
I don’t know how someone controlled you 
They bought and sold you.

I look at the world and I notice it’s turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps 
I don’t know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don’t know how you were inverted
No one alerted you.

I look at you all see the love there that’s sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all...
Still my guitar gently weeps.


Why don’t we do it in the road?

Why don’t we do it in the road?
No one will be watching us
Why don’t we do it in the road?


Wild honey pie

Honey Pie,
Honey Pie,
I love you, Honey Pie


Within you without you

We were talking-about the space between us all
And the people-who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth-then it’s far too late-when they pass away.
We were talking-about the love we all could share-when we find it
To try our best to hold it there-with our love
With our love-we could save the world-if they only knew.
Try to realise it’s all within yourself
No-one else can make you change
And to see you’re really only very small,
And life flows within you and without you.
We were talking-about the love that’s gone so cold and the people,
Who gain the world and lose their soul-
They don’t know-they can’t see-are you one of them?
When you’ve seen beyond yourself-then you may find, peace of mind,
Is waiting there-
And the time will come when you see
we’re all one, and life flows on within you and without you.


Words of love

Hold me close and tell me how you feel
Tell me love is real
Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling I love you 

Let me hear you say the words I long to hear
Darling when you’re near
Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling I love you


Yellow submarine

[Spoken introduction:]
Yellow Submarine... And we would march till
three in the day to see them gather there. From
Land of Goats to Jonah Green we’d step in duty
trail to see his yellow submarine, we love it

In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines

So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

And our friends are all on board
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

As we live a life of ease
Everyone of us has all we need
Sky of blue and sea of green
In our yellow submarine.

We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine


Yer blues

Yes I’m lonely wanna die
Yes I’m lonely wanna die
If I ain’t dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why.

In the morning wanna die
In the evening wanna die
If I ain’t dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why.

My mother was of the sky
My father was of the earth
But I am of the universe
And you know what it’s worth
I’m lonely wanna die 
If I ain’t dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why.

The eagle picks my eye
The worm he licks my bone
I feel so suicidal
Just like Dylan’s Mr. Jones
Lonely wanna die
If I ain’t dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why.

Black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist round my soul
Feel so suicidal
Even hate my rock and roll
Wanna die yeah wanna die
If I ain’t dead already


Yes it is

If you wear red tonight,
Remember what I said tonight.
For red is the colour that my baby wore,
And what is more, it’s true,
Yes it is.
Scarlet were the clothes she wore,
Everybody knows I’ve sure.
I would remember all the things we planned,
Understand, it’s true,
Yes it is, it’s true.
Yes it is.
I could be happy with you by my side
If I could forget her, but it’s my pride.
Yes it is, yes it is.
Oh, yes it is, yeah.
“Please don’t wear red tonight.”
This is what I said tonight.
For red is the colour that will make me blue,
In spite of you, it’s true,
Yes it is, it’s true.
Yes it is.
I could be happy with you by my side
If I could forget her, but it’s my pride.
Yes it is, yes it is.
Oh, yes it is, yeah.
“Please don’t wear red tonight.”
This is what I said tonight.
For red is the colour that will make me blue,
In spite of you, it’s true,
Yes it is, it’s true.
Yes it is, it’s true.


Yesterday

Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they’re here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly, I’m not half to man I used to be,
There’s a shadow hanging over me.
Oh, yesterday came suddenly.

Why she had to go I don’t know she woldn’t say.
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play.
Now I need a place to hide away.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.


You can’t do that

I got something to say that might cause you pain,
If I catch you talking to that boy again,

I’m gonna let you down,
And leave you flat,
Because I told you before, oh,
You can’t do that.

Well, it’s the second time, I’ve caught you talking to him,
Do I have to tell you one more time, I think it’s a sin,
I think I’ll let you down.
Let you down and leave you flat,
Gonna let you down and leave you flat,
Because I’ve told you before, oh,
You can’t do that.

Ev’rybody’s green,
‘cause I’m the one, who won your love,
But if it’s seen,
You’re talking that way they’d laugh in my face.
So please listen to me, if you wanna stay mine,
I can’t help my feelings, I’ll go out of my mind.

I know I’ll let you down,
And leave you flat,
Gonna let you down and leave you flat,
Because I’ve told you before, oh,
You can’t do that.

You like me too much

Though you’ve gone away this morning,
You’ll be back again tonight,
Telling me there’ll be no next time
If I don’t just don’t treat you right,
You’ll never leave me and you know it’s true,
‘cause you like me too much and I like you.

You’ve tried before to leave me, 
But you haven’t got the nerve
To walk out and make me lonely
Which is all that I deserve,

You’ll never leave me and you know it’s true,
‘cause you like me too much and I like you.
I really do, and it’s nice when you believe me,
If you leave me 

I will follow I will follow you 
And bring you back where you belong
‘cause I could’t really stand it,
I admit that I was wrong,

I wouldn’t let you leave me ‘cause it’s true,
‘cause you like me too much and I like you.

If you leave me 

I will follow I will follow you 
and bring you back where you belong

I admit that I was wrong,

I wouldn’t let you leave me ‘cause it’s true,
‘cause you like me too much and I like you,
‘cause you like me too much and I like you.


You never give me your money You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
and in the middle of negotiations
you break down

I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
and in the middle of investigation
I break down

Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money’s gone, nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling
Nowhere to go

One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we’ll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Came true today (yes it did)

One two three four five six seven,
All good children go to Heaven


You really got a hold on me

I don’t like you
But I love you
See that I’m always
Thinking of you
Oh, oh, oh,
You treat me badly
I love you madly
You’ve really got a hold on me
You’ve really got a hold on me, baby

I don’t want you,
But I need you
Don’t want to kiss you
But I need you
Oh, oh, oh
You do me wring now
My love is strong now
You’ve really got a hold on me
You’ve really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me

I want to leave you
Don’t want to stay here
Don’t want to spend 
Another day here
Oh, oh, oh, I want to split now
I just can quit now
You’ve really got a hold on me
You’ve really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me

You’ve really got a hold on me

You won’t see me

That was so hard to find
And I will lost my mind
If you won’t see me
You won’t see me

I don’t know why 
You should want to hide
But I can’t get through
My hands are tied
I won’t want to stay
I don’t gave much to say
But I can’t turn away
And you won’t see me
You won’t see me

Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn’t mind
If I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few
They’re filled with tears
And since I lost you
It feels like years
Yes, it seems so long
Girl, since you’ve been gone
And I just can’t go on
If you won’t see me

You’ve got to hide your love away

Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she’s gone I can’t go on
Feelin’ two-foot small

Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

Hey you’ve got to hide your love away
Hey you’ve got to hide your love away

How could I even try
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I’m in

How could she say to me
Love will find a way
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say

Hey you’ve got to hide your love away
Hey you’ve got to hide your love away
