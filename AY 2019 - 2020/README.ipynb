    "\n",
    "The material is organized by lessons. This means that **multiple** MCP handbook chapters can be covered in a single class. For example: in lesson 07 material from chapters 5 and 11 is covered. Note that the even lessons (2, 4, ...) are practical sessions, while the odd lessons are theory sessions. Test 1 can be found in lesson 6, test 2 in lesson 12. In line with the previous academic year, this course uses ```scikit-learn``` to teach the students how to model. "
