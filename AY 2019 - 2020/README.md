## Overview

This subfolder contains the code used for the MCP course (1 Master Exp. Psych. Ghent University) for AY 2019-2020.
Note: this folder is *not* maintained.

## Organization

The material is organized by lessons. This means that **multiple** MCP handbook chapters can be covered in a single class. For example: in lesson 07 material from chapters 5 and 11 is covered. Note that the even lessons (2, 4, ...) are practical sessions, while the odd lessons are theory sessions. Test 1 can be found in lesson 6, test 2 in lesson 12. In line with the previous academic year, this course uses ```scikit-learn``` to teach the students how to model. 

## Programming environment   

When last tested, all code could be executed using:

- python 3 (*v. 3.7.4*)
- anaconda (*v. 4.9.1*)
    
Install missing packages (e.g. both ```sklearn``` and ```scipy``` were needed for this course) using ```conda install [packageName]```
