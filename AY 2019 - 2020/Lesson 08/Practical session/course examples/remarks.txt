florence recap:
v rename the variables -> is it this group or not this group?
v make the dimensions clearer, not use np ravel
v add some noise, more or less training, patterns more resembling
v say that there will be more programming than in the other test
v relabel to 0, 1, 2 --> setosa, virginica
v which variables are linearly separable?
v Use features, and check whether the problem is linearly separable
v Dont use a fixed seed, or even better: leave it out
v leave pandas out for the adept exercise
v Rephrase as classify 0 vs the rest, or 1 vs the rest
