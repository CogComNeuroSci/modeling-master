## Used folder structure   

In this paragraph, we will quickly explain the folder structure that is used in this repository.
This folder organisation can be seen clearly in the [AC 2019 - 2020 folder][AC2019_2020].

The folder is organised according to the teaching schedule:

- Lesson 01
- Lesson 02
- ...
- Lesson 13

Within each _lesson xx_ folder, one can find another folder.   
Possible folder names are:

- Chapter xx
    - Which refers to the chapter in the _Modeling book_ the teacher will be talking about
- Practical session
    - Which indicates that this lesson will be used to let the students gain _practical experience_
- Test x
    - Which indicates that this folder contains scripts used for testing the modeling students

Finally, within each folder, another specific structure is enforced:

- Chapter xx
    - Course examples:
        - Contains code that is used during teaching, e.g. to show examples of certain modeling concepts
- Practical session:
    - Course examples:
        - Contains code that is used during teaching, e.g. to show examples of certain modeling concepts
    - exercises
        - Contains the scripts that the students will start with during the practical session
    - solutions
        - Contains the solutions to the aforementioned exercises
- Test x:
    - assignment
        - Contains the code the students start with during the test
    - solution
        - Contains the solution to that specific test
