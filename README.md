## Overview

This folder contains the code attached to the MCP handbook. The book is written by Tom Verguts; he thanks Esther De Loof, Mehdi Senoussi, and Pieter Huycke for lots of coding inspiration.

## Organization

The folders are organized according to chapter. The chapters line up with the MCP handbook.


## Programming environment   

We rely heavily on Python 3 incorporated in the Anaconda environment. Several modules are required to run the scripts, but the most important softwares are:

- python 3 (*v. 3.7.9*)
- anaconda 3 (*v. 4.9.1*)
- TensorFlow 1 (*v. 1.14.0*)

Note that we always work with Anaconda via virtual environments.   
Our preferred editor is Spyder.
