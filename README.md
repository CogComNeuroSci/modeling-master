## Overview

This root folder contains most of the code used for the MCP course (1 Master Exp. Psych. Ghent University) for the last three academic years (18-19; 19-20; 20-21).

## Organization

Each folder is named of the academic year it is used in. Note that for AY 2020-2021 two folders are avaiable. <mark>Students enrolled in the MCP course in AY 20-21 should work with the code stored in the "code by chapter" folder, since this is the code that is used during the course</mark>. The folder "MCP code new version" contains similar code, but is organized is a slightly different fashion.

For the previous academic years everything concerning organization is explained in their specific README files.

If you have questions, you can ask your question on the [Ufora forum](https://ufora.ugent.be/d2l/home) or via mail (see below). The question on the forum is preferred since everyone can profit from this.

## Programming environment   

We have used various programs in the MCP course, all relying on Python 3.

- AY 18-19: scikit-learn and scipy
- AY 19-20: scikit-learn and scipy
- AY 20-21: TensorFlow 1

Note that we always worked with Anaconda via virtual environments. Our preferred editor was Spyder.
