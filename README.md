## Overview

This folder contains the code attached to the MCP handbook. The book is written by Tom Verguts; he thanks Esther De Loof, Mehdi Senoussi, and Pieter Huycke for lots of coding inspiration.

## Organization

The folders are organized according to chapter. The chapters line up with the MCP handbook.


## Programming environment   

We rely heavily on Python 3 incorporated in the Anaconda environment. The most recent scripts use TensorFlow 2 (TF2); I highly recommend TF2, rather than the earlier TF1. Several modules are required to run the scripts, but the most important softwares are:

- Python 3 (*v. 3.6)
- Anaconda 3 (*v. 4.10.3)
- TensorFlow 2 (*v. 2.4)

Note that we always work with Anaconda via virtual environments.   
Our preferred editor is Spyder. You can use our own TensorFlow 2 environment by creating a new environment with the modelling_mac.yml or modelling_windows.yml files.
